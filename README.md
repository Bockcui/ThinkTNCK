Project Title: Shape Shift



Project Description: This project will be an android app developed through Android Studio. The app will be centered around a game where the user is presented with a set of random shapes for a short amount of time, after this the user will have to recreate the order of the shapes by selecting from a set of icons which are identical to the shapes presented before. If the user recreates the pattern correctly they will progress to the next round, if not the game will end and show their score, which is the amount of rounds they lasted.

The UI will be based on 4 buttons depicting a square, circle, triangle, and diamond. The game will start by highlighting a single shape for a short time which the user must then click, the next round will move to two shapes being highlighted one after the other, this presentation and recall pattern will continue with the speed of the highlighting increasing over time and the number of shapes being highlighted also increasing. The game will end once the user incorrectly inputs the pattern 3 times.
